# Stacks-and-Queues
This section contains implementations and exercises focused on the fundamental data structures Stack and Queue in Java.

Stacks follow the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, while Queues follow the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. The tasks here demonstrate their core operations such as push, pop, peek (for stacks) and offer, poll, peek (for queues), along with practical problem-solving applications.

These exercises help build a strong foundation for understanding data structures, algorithm design, and efficient problem solving.
